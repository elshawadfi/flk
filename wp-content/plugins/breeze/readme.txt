Breeze is a WordPress Caching Plugin developed by Cloudways. Breeze uses advance caching systems to improve WordPress loading times exponentially.

== Description ==

Breeze is a free, simple (yet powerful) and user-friendly WordPress Caching Plugin developed by the Cloudways team. It offers various options to optimize WordPress performance at various levels. It works equally great with WordPress, WordPress with WooCommerce and WordPress Multisite.

Breeze excels in the following areas:

* **Performance:** Breeze improves website speed and resource optimization. Other features include file level cache system, database cleanup, minification, support for Varnish cache and simplified CDN integration options.

* **Convenience:** Breeze is easy to install and configure directly from WordPress. Configuring Breeze is easy and most of the default options work well right out of the box. The recommended settings should work on all your WordPress websites seamlessly.

* **Simplicity:** Breeze is designed to be simple for all users. Just install and activate the plugin and you'll see the results instantaneously.

What makes Breeze WordPress Cache Plugin awesome is that it comes with builtin support for Varnish. If Varnish is not installed on your servers, Breeze will utilize its internal cache mechanism to boost up your WordPress site performance.

**Support:** We love to provide support! Post your questions on the WordPress.org support forums, or if you are a Cloudways Customer you may ask questions on the <a href="https://community.cloudways.com/">Cloudways Community Forum</a>.

**Special Thanks:** We would like to give special mention to WP Speed Of Light for being an inspiration for Breeze.

Breeze is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite without the need for any extra configuration.

= How does Breeze handle WordPress multisite? =

Breeze handles all WordPress multisite instances globally. All the settings for multisite are now handled on the network level.

= Is Breeze compatible with other WordPress Cache plugins? =

We DO NOT recommend using two WordPress cache plugins at the same time on any WordPress website.
We strongly recommend that you use Breeze as the only cache plugin for your website. If there are any other cache plugins installed, please ensure that you have disabled them prior to proceeding with the Breeze installation.

= Does Breeze support CDN? =

Breeze supports CDN integration. It allows all static assets (such as images, CSS and JS files) to be served via CDN.

= What does Breeze's Database Optimization feature do? =

WordPress databases are notorious for storing information like post revisions, spam comments and much more. Over time, databases l become bloated and it is a good practice to clear out unwanted information to reduce database size and improve optimization.

Breeze's database optimization cleans out unwanted information in a single click.

Comments will appear upon moderation as per the comment system (or policy) set in place by the blog owner. Other dynamic changes such as any modifications in files will require a full cache purge.

You can exclude a file by mentioning its URL or file type (by mentioning file extension) in the exclude fields (available in the Breeze settings). Exclude will not let the cache impact that URL or file type.

If Varnish is active, you will need to exclude URLs and file type(s) in the Varnish configuration. If you are hosting WordPress websites on Cloudways servers, follow <a href="https://support.cloudways.com/how-to-exclude-url-from-varnish/">this KB to exclude URLs from the Varnish cache</a>.
